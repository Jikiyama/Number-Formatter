*This program is written in Java version 8, Update 111 (build 1.8.0_111-b14)*

HOW TO USE:
The test class tests the accounting formatter, the base formatter, and the decimal separator. The base formatter tests the case for all bases 2 through 32,
from 0 to 24.

SAMPLE INPUT:
-23
1000000
20
24

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
(23)
1,000,000
Decimal: 20
Binary: 10100
Hex: 18

Abstract:
This program provides three classes that implement the NumberFormatter interface. Base formatter that converts the number to the base specified by the constructor,
the accounting formatter that places negative numbers in parenthesis, and the decimal separator which adds commas when the numbers exceed 10^3 and above. The algorithm used by
the base converter uses the division with remainder method. Three examples are provided on the attached PDF.

Data structure used:
Arrays for splitting the strings into char arrays and vice versa.
